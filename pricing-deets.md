## Gemini 2.5 Flash Native Audio (Live API)

*`gemini-2.5-flash-native-audio-preview-09-2025`*


Our [Live API](https://ai.google.dev/gemini-api/docs/live) native audio
models optimized for higher quality audio outputs with better pacing,
voice naturalness, verbosity, and mood.

Preview models may change before becoming stable and have more
restrictive rate limits.

| Input price | Free of charge | $0.50 (text), $3.00 (audio / video) |

The Live API also includes half-cascade audio generation models:

  image / video), Output: \$1.50 (text), \$8.50 (audio)

These models will be deprecated soon.
